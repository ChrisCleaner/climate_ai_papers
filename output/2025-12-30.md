# Research Summary: Corporate Emissions Reductions and Avoided Mortality

**Main Contribution:**
Demonstrates that individual corporate emissions reductions have quantifiable life-saving impacts by linking company-level emission pledges to avoided temperature-related deaths. Reframes corporate climate action from negligible planetary contributions to meaningful mortality reduction.

**Method:**
- Creates 2020-2049 emissions scenarios (with/without pledged reductions) for 3,084 companies
- Uses climate emulator to calculate 2020-2100 warming trajectories from each scenario
- Applies mortality damage functions to temperature outputs to estimate avoided deaths

**Data:**
Company-reported emissions and emissions reduction pledges; climate model outputs; temperature-mortality relationships (damage functions).

**Climate Relevance:**
Bridges corporate climate commitments to physical climate outcomes by quantifying the warming mitigation from individual company actions, addressing the perception gap between local corporate efforts and global climate impacts.

**Implications:**
Provides accountability mechanism for corporate climate pledges; enables companies to communicate concrete life-saving benefits of emissions reductions to stakeholders; potentially increases corporate climate ambition by demonstrating individual significance.

**Limitations:**
Assumes companies follow through on pledges; mortality damage functions may have regional/temporal uncertainties; analysis limited to temperature-related deaths (excludes other climate impacts); company sample representativeness unclear.

**TL;DR:**
Individual corporate emissions reductions can each save lives; 97% of analyzed companies could prevent at least one death through their pledges, totaling 4.4 million avoided deaths if all follow through.

# Research Summary: Silica Aerosols and Stratospheric Chemistry

**Main Contribution:**
Combines molecular dynamics simulations with kinetic modeling to assess whether silica-based aerosols used in stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) trigger ozone-depleting chemistry. Finds that despite thermodynamically favorable pathways, surface chemistry effects limit the risk of chlorine activation on silica surfaces.

**Method:**
- First-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of HCl + ClONO₂ heterogeneous reactions on hydroxylated α-quartz surfaces
- Kinetic model parameterized by MD results and experimental data to calculate reaction probability (γ_ClONO₂)
- Surface affinity and partial pressure analysis to predict reaction rates in stratospheric conditions

**Data:**
MD-derived reaction pathways and activation barriers; experimental data on surface affinities and partial pressures of HCl, ClONO₂, and HNO₃; stratospheric composition parameters.

**Climate Relevance:**
Evaluates safety of proposed geoengineering technology (SAI with silica aerosols) for albedo enhancement, specifically addressing unintended ozone depletion risks from chlorine chemistry—a critical concern for solar radiation management deployment.

**Implications:**
Silica-based SAI candidates appear safer regarding HCl/ClONO₂-driven ozone loss than previously uncertain. Supports continued investigation of silica aerosols as geoengineering materials, though validates need for experimental validation before real-world deployment.

**Limitations:**
Scarcity of experimental heterogeneous chemistry data; theoretical framework for translating MD results to kinetic models needs refinement; single silica surface composition studied; doesn't address other ozone-loss pathways or aerosol interactions.

**TL;DR:**
Silica aerosols for geoengineering show limited risk of activating stratospheric chlorine chemistry, but experimental validation is urgently needed before deployment.

# Research Summary: Persistent Homology in Porous Media Convection

**Main Contribution:**
Applies persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis technique, to quantify complex flow patterns in porous media convection. Establishes correlations between topological measures of flow structures and macroscopic heat transport efficiency (Nusselt number).

**Method:**
• Persistent homology analysis to extract objective, scale-invariant topological features from temperature/concentration fields
• Simulations of classical porous media configurations (one-sided and Rayleigh-Bénard convection)
• Parameter sweep across Rayleigh-Darcy numbers and domain sizes
• Correlation analysis between PH-derived metrics and heat transport rates

**Data:**
Large-scale simulation datasets combining original computations and previously published results, made publicly available for reproducibility.

**Climate Relevance:**
Directly applicable to CO₂ sequestration in geological formations and groundwater contaminant transport—both critical for climate mitigation and environmental protection. Understanding convective mixing dynamics improves predictions of subsurface fluid behavior in carbon storage and remediation scenarios.

**Implications:**
Provides quantitative, objective framework for characterizing mixing efficiency in porous media without manual pattern identification. Enables better predictive models for industrial and geophysical applications requiring precise mixing control.

**Limitations:**
Focuses on idealized porous media geometries; applicability to heterogeneous natural formations requires further validation.

**TL;DR:**
Persistent homology quantifies convective flow patterns in porous media, revealing structure-transport relationships relevant to CO₂ sequestration and contaminant transport.

# Research Summary: Pumped Hydro as Gas Alternative

**Main Contribution:**
Demonstrates that long-duration pumped hydro storage can replace fossil gas in electricity systems without cost penalties, and introduces a temporal aggregation method that accurately captures storage behavior for grid planning.

**Method:**
• Temporal segmentation approach (fitted chronology) for time-series optimization
• Full-series optimization comparison to validate accuracy
• Electricity system model evaluating millions of near-optimal renewable pathways
• Techno-economic analysis of off-river pumped hydro sites globally

**Data:**
Chronological electricity demand and renewable generation profiles; geographic/hydrological data for pumped hydro site identification (specific datasets not detailed in abstract).

Eliminates reliance on fossil gas—a major methane emission source—enabling 100% renewable electricity systems while avoiding combustion-related greenhouse gases and methane leakage from gas infrastructure.

**Implications:**
• Challenges planning bias toward gas in long-term energy models
• Shows most global regions can achieve decarbonized grids using locally-available pumped hydro
• Enables rapid evaluation of transition pathways for policy and investment decisions
• Reframes storage economics: emphasizes low energy volume cost (<$50/kWh), long asset lifetime (~75 years), and appropriate discount rates

**Limitations:**
Assumes availability of suitable off-river pumped hydro sites; environmental/social feasibility of site development not addressed; relies on specific economic assumptions (discount rates, costs).

**TL;DR:**
Pumped hydro storage can economically replace fossil gas in grids with high solar/wind penetration, with improved modeling methods revealing globally viable decarbonization pathways.

# Long-Range Distillation for AI Weather Models: Summary

**Main Contribution:**
Introduces long-range distillation, a method that trains single-step probabilistic models to forecast weather at subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales by distilling knowledge from 10,000+ years of synthetic climate data generated by an autoregressive teacher model.

**Method:**
• Knowledge distillation: Student model learns to replicate teacher (DLESyM) outputs directly at long timesteps rather than through iterative autoregressive steps
• Synthetic data generation: Teacher model produces massive synthetic climate dataset to overcome training data scarcity
• Probabilistic framework: Student generates probabilistic forecasts rather than deterministic predictions
• Fine-tuning: ERA5 reanalysis used to calibrate models for real-world performance

**Data:**
• Teacher training: ERA5 reanalysis (40-year record)
• Student training: 10,000+ years of synthetic climate simulations from DLESyM
• Evaluation: Perfect-model experiments and real-world S2S forecasts compared against ECMWF ensemble

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses critical limitation in seasonal forecasting—capturing slow climate modes (e.g., ocean oscillations, soil moisture) that drive predictability beyond 2 weeks. Single-step forecasting eliminates error accumulation that degrades traditional iterative approaches.

**Implications:**
Demonstrates AI-generated synthetic data can scale forecast skill beyond observational record limits; enables computationally efficient long-range predictions; applicable to operational seasonal forecasting systems.

**Limitations:**
Perfect-model skill doesn't fully transfer to real-world observations; ERA5 fine-tuning required for competitive performance; computational cost of generating 10,000-year synthetic dataset not detailed.

**TL;DR:**
Distilling synthetic climate simulations into single-step AI models achieves competitive seasonal forecast skill while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with one inference.
