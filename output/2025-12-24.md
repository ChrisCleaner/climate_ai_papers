# Field-Space Attention for Structure-Preserving Earth System Transformers

**Main Contribution:**
Introduces Field-Space Attention, a novel Transformer mechanism that performs attention computations directly in the physical domain rather than learned latent spaces, preserving the geometric structure of geophysical fields throughout the network.

**Method:**
• Computes attention in physical space while maintaining continuous field representations on a sphere
• Uses fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition to integrate coarse and fine-scale information
• Learns structure-preserving deformations of input fields rather than arbitrary latent transformations
• Avoids optimization instabilities common in standard Vision Transformers through this design

**Data:**
Global temperature super-resolution on HEALPix grid (specific datasets not detailed in abstract).

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses the critical need for physically consistent machine learning models in Earth system dynamics, where preserving field geometry and enabling constraint enforcement are essential for reliable climate predictions.

**Implications:**
Enables embedding of physical and statistical priors directly into architecture; provides interpretable internal states for scientific validation; applicable to next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

**Limitations:**
Evaluation demonstrated on single task (temperature super-resolution); generalization to other Earth system variables and broader climate modeling scenarios not explicitly addressed.

**TL;DR:**
Field-Space Attention preserves physical field structure in Transformers, enabling more stable, interpretable, and physically grounded Earth system modeling with fewer parameters.

# Research Summary: Corporate Emissions Reductions and Life-Saving Potential

**Main Contribution:**
Develops a quantitative framework linking individual corporate emissions reductions to avoided mortality, demonstrating that even small companies can prevent temperature-related deaths through their sustainability commitments.

**Method:**
- Creates 2020-2049 emissions scenarios (with/without pledged reductions) for 3,084 companies
- Uses climate emulator to project 2020-2100 warming trajectories from each scenario
- Applies mortality damage functions to temperature outputs to calculate avoided deaths

**Data:**
Corporate emissions reports and emissions reduction pledges from 3,084 companies across multiple sectors and sizes.

# Research Summary: Resolution Optimization in Climate Impact Modeling

**Main Contribution:**
Demonstrates that higher-resolution climate data does not uniformly improve impact model performance across all sectors and regions. Identifies a critical resolution threshold (60 km → 10 km) beyond which gains diminish substantially.

**Method:**
Cross-sectoral impact model intercomparison using the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) framework, comparing model performance across four spatial resolutions (60 km, 10 km, 3 km, 1 km) to isolate resolution-dependent skill improvements.

**Data:**
High-resolution climate and forcing datasets at multiple resolutions; temperature and precipitation variables; simulations spanning multiple impact sectors and global regions with varying topography.

**Climate Relevance:**
Directly addresses the efficiency of climate downscaling investments for impact assessments. Reveals that computational costs of ultra-fine resolution (1-3 km) may not justify marginal improvements in policy-relevant projections, particularly for precipitation-driven systems.

**Implications:**
- Data providers should prioritize 10 km resolution as cost-effective optimum for most applications
- Impact modelers must benchmark resolution choices sector- and region-specifically rather than assuming finer = better
- Improved downscaling techniques and process representation needed to unlock benefits of sub-10 km scales

**Limitations:**
Study scope limited to ISIMIP models; results may not generalize to all impact sectors or downscaling methodologies; underlying causes of precipitation performance degradation at fine scales require further investigation.

**TL;DR:**
Resolution improvements beyond 10 km provide inconsistent and modest benefits for climate impact models, with gains highly dependent on sector and topography.

# Research Summary: Deep Ensembles for ENSO Uncertainty Quantification

**Main Contribution:**
Demonstrates that deep ensembles effectively distinguish between epistemic (model) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainty in ENSO prediction, with epistemic uncertainty reliably tracking predictive error growth under climate change scenarios. Shows that aleatoric uncertainty becomes unreliable under distributional shifts, challenging its use as a confidence metric.

**Method:**
Deploys ensembles of probabilistic neural networks on CESM2-LE data to quantify two uncertainty types: ensemble disagreement (epistemic) and model-predicted variance (aleatoric). Evaluates uncertainty signals against predictive errors in SST, OHC, and zonal wind stress anomalies.

**Data:**
Community Earth System Model 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE)—a high-resolution climate simulation dataset with multiple ensemble members under historical and climate change scenarios.

**Climate Relevance:**
ENSO is the dominant mode of interannual climate variability affecting global weather patterns and predictability. Understanding uncertainty in ENSO predictions is critical for seasonal forecasting and climate adaptation planning.

**Implications:**
Provides guidance for climate prediction systems: epistemic uncertainty should be prioritized for model confidence assessment under climate change, while aleatoric uncertainty alone may mislead decision-makers. Ensemble methods become increasingly valuable as climate distributions shift.

**Limitations:**
Analysis limited to single model (CESM2); generalization to other climate models and prediction systems unclear. Focuses on specific variables; broader applicability to other climate phenomena requires further investigation.

**TL;DR:**
Epistemic uncertainty from deep ensembles reliably tracks ENSO prediction errors under climate change, while aleatoric uncertainty fails under distributional shift.

# Research Summary: Early-Warning Signals for AMOC Collapse

**Main Contribution:**
Demonstrates that early-warning signals (EWS) for Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapse depend critically on which observable is monitored, and that sequential partial collapses in different deep water formation regions complicate predictions of full system collapse.

**Method:**
Conceptual dynamical systems model featuring two coupled deep water formation regions with multiple tipping points; analyzes bifurcation structure beyond standard saddle-node normal form to evaluate how different observables exhibit divergent EWS trends.

**Data:**
Theoretical/model-based study; no empirical datasets explicitly mentioned. Findings applicable to climate model outputs and AMOC fingerprints.

**Climate Relevance:**
AMOC is a critical component of global heat redistribution; potential collapse would dramatically alter Northern Hemisphere climate, precipitation patterns, and sea levels. Understanding collapse mechanisms and detection windows is essential for climate risk assessment.

**Implications:**
Observable selection is crucial for AMOC monitoring systems; current EWS approaches may fail to distinguish partial from full collapse scenarios, potentially undermining early-warning frameworks used in climate policy and adaptation planning.

**Limitations:**
Conceptual model may oversimplify real AMOC dynamics; unclear how findings transfer to high-dimensional climate models or observational data with noise; sequential collapse assumption requires validation.

**TL;DR:**
Which AMOC fingerprint you monitor determines whether early-warning signals predict partial or full collapse, complicating real-world early-detection strategies.

**Limitations:**
Focus limited to European domain; generalizability to other regions unclear. Assumes current trends persist for future projections, which may not account for nonlinear climate responses.

**TL;DR:**
Machine learning reveals that European heatwaves cluster into distinct circulation types with different climate change signatures, requiring type-specific monitoring and projection strategies.

# Research Summary: CfD Design and Renewable Energy Risk Management

**Main Contribution:**
Analyzes how different Contract for Difference (CfD) designs affect strike price optimization and market risk distribution in high-renewable electricity systems. Reveals a critical trade-off between financial risk reduction for investors and maintaining price signals for system-efficient investment decisions.

**Method:**
• Analytical derivation of optimal strike prices under uncertainty
• Numerical optimization across 36 market scenarios using an energy system model
• Comparative analysis of three CfD designs' effects on profit/price volatility distributions
• Sector-coupled electricity market modeling to capture interdependencies
