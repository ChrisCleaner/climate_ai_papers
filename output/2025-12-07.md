# NORi: ML-Augmented Ocean Boundary Layer Parameterization

**Main Contribution:**
Develops NORi, a hybrid physics-neural network parameterization for ocean boundary layer turbulence that combines Richardson number-dependent diffusivity closures with neural ODEs to capture non-local entrainment processes. Achieves superior generalization and numerical stability compared to traditional parameterizations while requiring minimal training data.

**Method:**
• Physics base: Richardson number (Ri)-dependent diffusivity/viscosity closure
• ML component: Neural ODEs trained to capture entrainment at boundary layer base
• Training approach: A posteriori calibration using time-integrated loss functions on LES data (targets actual variables of interest rather than noisy instantaneous subgrid fluxes)
• Realistic nonlinear equation of state for seawater incorporated

**Data:**
Large-eddy simulation (LES) datasets; trained on 2-day horizons with validation across varying convective strengths, stratifications, rotation rates, and wind forcings.

**Climate Relevance:**
Ocean boundary layer turbulence is critical for air-sea heat/momentum exchange and mixed layer dynamics—fundamental drivers of ocean circulation, heat transport, and climate variability. Accurate parameterization directly improves climate model fidelity.

**Implications:**
Enables 100+ year stable climate simulations with 1-hour time steps; reduces data requirements for ML-climate model integration; demonstrates that hybrid physics-ML approaches can achieve both interpretability and performance for climate applications.

**Limitations:**
Training limited to 2-day horizons; generalization to extreme conditions or climate change scenarios not explicitly discussed; computational cost of neural network inference in large-scale models not detailed.

**TL;DR:**
Physics-informed neural networks successfully parameterize ocean boundary layer turbulence with multi-century stability and strong generalization, advancing ML integration into climate models.

# Research Summary: Conditional Neural Network Weight Updates for Climate Applications

**Main Contribution:**
Proposes a method to improve neural network generalization when training and application data differ significantly (out-of-distribution scenarios). The approach systematically adjusts network weights based on predictors of the target domain to enable extrapolation beyond training conditions.

**Method:**
1. Retrain network on training data subsets; quantify resulting weight anomalies
2. Identify predictors correlated with weight changes
3. Regress predictors against weight anomalies to derive adjustment rules
4. Apply learned adjustments to extrapolate weights to new application domain

**Data:**
Three climate science case studies demonstrating temporal, spatial, and cross-domain extrapolations (specific datasets not detailed in abstract).

**Climate Relevance:**
Directly addresses critical climate modeling challenges: temporal shifts (climate change), spatial gaps (sparse observations), and domain transfer (e.g., model outputs to real-world applications). Enables neural networks to adapt across different climate regimes and geographic regions.

**Implications:**
Enhances predictive capability for climate variables under non-stationary conditions without retraining from scratch. Applicable to downscaling, regional climate projections, and bridging observational/model data gaps.

**Limitations:**
Method requires identifying appropriate predictors of weight behavior; effectiveness depends on reasonable correlation between predictors and weight anomalies. Scalability to very high-dimensional networks unclear.

**TL;DR:**
Conditional weight adjustment enables neural networks to extrapolate reliably across temporal, spatial, and domain shifts in climate applications.

# Research Summary: Snow Cover Modeling in Iberian Mountains

**Main Contribution:**
Demonstrates that storm-resolving global climate models (≤10 km resolution) can accurately simulate historical snow cover in complex mountain terrain and project future changes without requiring regional downscaling. Validates IFS-FESOM model performance against multiple observational datasets for the Iberian Peninsula.

**Method:**
- High-resolution climate simulation using IFS-FESOM (km-scale horizontal resolution)
- Model evaluation against four reanalysis products, satellite data, and in situ observations
- Future projections under SSP3-7.0 emissions scenario
- Analysis of elevation dependency, seasonal cycles, and spatial patterns

**Data:**
Four high-resolution reanalysis-based products; satellite observations; in situ measurements; historical and projected climate simulations from EU-NextGEMS project.

**Climate Relevance:**
Snow cover in Mediterranean mountains is critical for water resources, hydropower, and regional climate regulation. Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns directly threaten this resource in vulnerable regions like the Iberian Peninsula.

**Implications:**
Storm-resolving models enable local adaptation planning for water management and mountain communities without computationally expensive regional downscaling. Projected snow loss (especially at low-to-mid elevations and southern ranges) requires urgent water security strategies.

**Limitations:**
Model exhibits positive bias in snow season length and snowfall days; projections limited to single emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0); uncertainty ranges not fully quantified for future projections.

**TL;DR:**
Km-scale climate models successfully simulate Iberian snow cover and project substantial future reductions driven by warming and precipitation changes, enabling direct local climate adaptation planning.

**Relevance Score:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

# Research Summary: Power Outages and Residential Solar Adoption

**Main Contribution:**
Quantifies the causal relationship between power outage exposure and residential PV adoption rates using high-resolution household data. Demonstrates that grid unreliability creates a negative feedback loop that could undermine decarbonization targets as climate change increases outage frequency.

**Method:**
Two-part econometric panel model applied to 377,726 households in Indianapolis (2014-2023) to isolate causal effects of outage exposure on new PV installations, controlling for confounding variables.

**Data:**
Household-level PV installation records (377,726 homes, Indianapolis); power outage duration and frequency data; climate projections under RCP 4.5 scenario through 2040.

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses a critical feedback mechanism: climate-driven increases in extreme weather events (storms, heat) will increase grid failures, which paradoxically discourage adoption of distributed solar systems needed for climate mitigation and adaptation.

**Implications:**
Policy integration of grid resilience and clean energy is essential; current PV-only systems lack battery backup, limiting their appeal during outages. Findings suggest need for incentives favoring PV+storage systems or grid hardening investments to maintain decarbonization momentum.

**Limitations:**
Single-city analysis (Indianapolis) may limit generalizability; assumes outage data accurately reflects household-level exposure; does not examine adoption of PV+battery systems separately.

**TL;DR:**
Increasing power outages reduce solar adoption by ~31%, creating a vicious cycle that threatens decarbonization as climate change worsens grid reliability.
