# Research Summary: Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with ML Surrogates

**Main Contribution:**
Proposes a Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter (MF-EnKF) that combines expensive high-fidelity physical models with fast machine learning surrogates as low-fidelity models. Demonstrates that this hybrid approach achieves higher accuracy than either model alone within equivalent computational budgets.

**Method:**
Ensemble Kalman Filter framework where low-fidelity component is an ML surrogate (trained on expensive model outputs) rather than traditional reduced-order or coarse-resolution models. Leverages many cheap ML ensemble members alongside fewer expensive full-model runs to increase effective ensemble size while controlling computational cost.

Tested on two standard atmospheric/oceanic dynamical systems: Lorenz-2005 (chaotic atmospheric model) and Quasi-Geostrophic model (simplified ocean/atmosphere dynamics).

**Climate Relevance:**
Directly applicable to weather prediction and oceanographic forecasting, where data assimilation via EnKF is standard practice. Addresses the computational bottleneck limiting ensemble sizes in operational meteorology and climate modeling.

**Implications:**
Enables more accurate initial condition estimation for weather/ocean forecasts without proportional computational cost increases. Scalable approach for integrating ML into existing operational prediction systems in meteorology and oceanography.

**Limitations:**
Testing limited to idealized dynamical systems; real-world applicability to high-dimensional atmospheric/oceanic models requires further validation. ML surrogate training costs and generalization to out-of-distribution conditions not thoroughly discussed.

# Research Summary: Coastal Tidal Wetland Methane Emissions

**Main Contribution:**
Quantifies methane emissions from U.S. East Coast tidal marshes by integrating oceanographic and hydrological drivers often omitted from regional assessments. Reveals that salinity-inundation interactions create non-linear dynamics with critical thresholds for future emissions under sea-level rise.

**Method:**
Integrated modeling framework combining: ocean circulation models (salinity/inundation drivers), remote sensing data (marsh extent), and empirical relationships derived from metadata synthesis to estimate spatiotemporal methane flux patterns.

**Data:**
Ocean model outputs, remote sensing datasets (marsh mapping), temperature and salinity records, and empirical flux relationships from literature synthesis covering 2001–2020 with future projections.

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses a critical gap in coastal carbon budgets by quantifying how ocean-driven processes (tidal dynamics, salinity gradients) regulate methane—a potent greenhouse gas—in ecosystems vulnerable to sea-level rise and freshwater input changes.

**Implications:**
Identifies methane hotspots for targeted monitoring; demonstrates that sea-level rise will initially amplify emissions but salinity intrusion provides a natural suppression mechanism at ~0.75 m SLR, informing coastal adaptation strategies and carbon accounting models.

**Limitations:**
Empirical relationships may not capture non-linear biogeochemical responses; projections depend on IPCC scenario assumptions; spatial resolution and temporal coverage may mask fine-scale heterogeneity in marsh types.

**TL;DR:**
Coastal tidal marsh methane emissions are driven by salinity-inundation interactions with a critical threshold response to sea-level rise, requiring ocean-informed models for accurate regional carbon budgets.
