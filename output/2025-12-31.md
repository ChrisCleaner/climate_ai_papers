# Research Summary: Persistent Homology Analysis of Porous Media Convection

**Main Contribution:**
Introduces persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis technique, to objectively quantify complex flow patterns and mixing structures in porous media convection. Demonstrates correlation between topological measures and macroscopic heat transport (Nusselt number) across varying Rayleigh-Darcy numbers and domain sizes.

**Method:**
• Persistent homology: Tracks topological features (connected components, loops, voids) across all scalar field values simultaneously
• Analyzes classical configurations: one-sided and Rayleigh-Bénard convection in porous media
• Correlates PH-derived structural metrics with Nusselt number to link microscale topology to macroscale transport

**Data:**
Large-scale simulation datasets combining original computations and previously published results; datasets made publicly available for reproducibility.

**Climate Relevance:**
Directly applicable to CO₂ sequestration in geological formations and contaminant transport in groundwater—both critical for climate mitigation and environmental protection. Understanding convective mixing dynamics improves predictions of solute/heat transport in subsurface systems.

**Implications:**
Provides objective, parameter-independent tools for characterizing flow evolution in porous media, enabling better predictive models for carbon storage efficiency and groundwater contamination risk assessment.

**Limitations:**
Focuses on idealized configurations; applicability to heterogeneous, field-scale porous media requires further validation.

**TL;DR:**
Persistent homology quantifies convective flow patterns in porous media, linking topology to heat transport—with direct applications to CO₂ sequestration and groundwater modeling.

# Research Summary: Long-Range Distillation for AI Weather Models

**Main Contribution:**
Introduces "long-range distillation," a method that trains single-step probabilistic models to forecast weather at subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales by leveraging 10,000+ years of synthetic climate data generated from an autoregressive teacher model, eliminating error accumulation from repeated forecasting steps.

**Method:**
• Knowledge distillation: Student model learns to replicate long-range outputs of teacher model (DLESyM) in one step rather than iteratively
• Teacher generates synthetic training data via autoregressive rollouts; student trained on this massive synthetic dataset
• Probabilistic framework captures forecast uncertainty
• Fine-tuning on ERA5 reanalysis for real-world application

**Data:**
• Teacher training: ERA5 reanalysis (40 years)
• Student training: 10,000+ years of synthetic climate simulations from teacher
• Evaluation: Perfect-model experiments and real-world comparison against ECMWF ensemble forecasts

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses critical gap in seasonal predictability by capturing slow climate modes (e.g., ocean oscillations, land-surface memory) that require extensive sampling—impossible with limited observational records. Enables skillful forecasts of subseasonal-to-seasonal phenomena relevant to climate impacts.

**Implications:**
Demonstrates AI-generated synthetic data can scale forecast skill beyond observational constraints; offers computationally efficient alternative to ensemble methods; potential for operational seasonal forecasting and climate service applications.

**Limitations:**
Dependent on teacher model quality; perfect-model skill doesn't fully translate to real-world performance; fine-tuning on limited ERA5 may constrain generalization to future climate states.

**TL;DR:**
Synthetic climate data from AI models can train single-step seasonal forecasters that match ensemble forecast skill without autoregressive error accumulation.
