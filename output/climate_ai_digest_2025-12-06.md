Nevertheless, these metrics are heavily relied upon, both in the literature and at operational numerical weather prediction centers. In this study, we demonstrate theoretically why the Spread-Error relationship is necessary but insufficient for diagnosing reliability up to second order, even when mean bias is absent or accounted for. Assuming...
