# Research Summary: Generative ML for Precipitation Downscaling

**Main Contribution:**
Compares conditional GANs (cGANs) with intensity constraints against diffusion models for downscaling regional climate model precipitation to fine spatial scales. Demonstrates that cGANs better preserve climate change signals in extreme precipitation while diffusion models excel at spatial realism.

**Method:**
- **cGAN approach:** Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with intensity constraints
- **Diffusion models:** Multiple configurations tested as alternative generative approach
- **Baseline:** Deterministic ML method for comparison
- Evaluation across spatial structure, distributions, means, extremes, and climate change signals

**Data:**
Regional climate model (RCM) precipitation outputs downscaled over Aotearoa New Zealand at fine spatial resolution; present-day and future climate scenarios assessed.

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses critical gap in climate modeling: generating high-resolution precipitation projections that capture both fine-scale weather patterns and realistic extreme event intensification under climate change—essential for impact assessments and adaptation planning.

**Implications:**
cGANs offer practical advantage for operational climate downscaling by balancing computational efficiency with accurate climate change responses for extremes. Results caution against prioritizing visual realism over physical consistency in generative climate models.

**Limitations:**
Diffusion models underestimate extreme precipitation climate change signals; incorporating physical constraints into diffusion models remains technically challenging; evaluation limited to single region (New Zealand).

**TL;DR:**
cGANs with intensity constraints outperform diffusion models for climate-consistent precipitation downscaling despite lower visual realism.

# Research Summary: Multi-Fidelity Ensemble Kalman Filter with ML Surrogates

**Main Contribution:**
Demonstrates that machine learning surrogates can effectively serve as low-fidelity models in ensemble Kalman filtering, achieving higher accuracy than traditional reduced-order models within equivalent computational budgets. This hybrid approach leverages both expensive high-fidelity physics simulations and cheap ML predictions to improve data assimilation efficiency.

**Climate Relevance:**
Directly applicable to weather prediction and oceanographic forecasting, where computational constraints limit ensemble sizes in operational data assimilation systems. Addresses the critical bottleneck of running sufficient ensemble members for robust uncertainty quantification.

**Implications:**
Enables operational weather/ocean centers to improve forecast accuracy and uncertainty estimates without proportional increases in computational infrastructure. Scalable approach for integrating neural network surrogates into existing assimilation workflows.

**Limitations:**
Evaluation limited to idealized test problems; real-world performance on high-dimensional atmospheric/oceanic systems with complex model errors remains to be demonstrated.

**TL;DR:**

**Implications:**
Provides operational capability for monitoring meltwater distribution at scales relevant to glacier hydrology and ice dynamics; supports improved parameterization of meltwater runoff in ice sheet models and climate projections.

**Limitations:**
Study limited to single glacier system (Helheim); generalizability to other ice sheets and regions requires validation; non-deep learning SAR-based approach achieves competitive 90% accuracy, suggesting potential for simpler alternatives in data-rich scenarios.

**Method:**
- Analyzes forward SDE to derive mode-wise SNR decay with wavenumber, revealing fundamental spectral bias in standard DDPMs
- Proposes power-law noise schedules β(τ) ∝ τ^γ as spectral regularizers to maintain fine-scale information
- Introduces Lazy Diffusion: single-step score-based distillation that bypasses long reverse trajectories while preventing high-wavenumber degradation

# Research Summary: Coastal Tidal Wetland Methane Emissions

**Main Contribution:**
Quantifies methane emissions from U.S. East Coast tidal marshes by integrating oceanographic and hydrological drivers often omitted from regional assessments. Reveals that salinity-inundation interactions create non-linear dynamics, with emissions peaking at intermediate sea-level rise before saltwater intrusion suppresses further growth.

**Method:**
Coupled ocean modeling with remote sensing data and empirical flux relationships derived from metadata synthesis. Spatiotemporal analysis isolates drivers of methane production: salinity gradients, tidal inundation frequency, temperature, and latitude effects on marsh biogeochemistry.

**Data:**
Ocean circulation model outputs, remote sensing datasets (marsh extent/inundation), empirical CH₄ flux measurements (2001–2020), IPCC climate scenarios for future projections.

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses a critical feedback mechanism: while wetlands sequester carbon, methane emissions (28–34× CO₂ warming potential over 100 years) partially offset this benefit. Coastal wetlands face dual pressures from sea-level rise and freshwater inputs, making their net climate impact uncertain without mechanistic understanding.

**Implications:**
Enables improved regional carbon accounting for coastal wetlands in climate models. Identifies salinity thresholds (~0.75 m SLR) where emission trajectories reverse, informing coastal adaptation and wetland management strategies.

**Limitations:**
Metadata-derived empirical relationships may not capture site-specific biogeochemical variability; projections assume linear climate forcing without accounting for potential ecosystem regime shifts or adaptation.

**TL;DR:**
Coastal marsh methane emissions peak under moderate sea-level rise but decline beyond a salinity threshold, revealing complex ocean-wetland interactions critical for coastal carbon budgets.
