# Research Summary: Coastal Tidal Wetland Methane Emissions

**Main Contribution:**
Quantifies methane emissions from U.S. East Coast tidal marshes by integrating oceanographic and hydrological drivers (salinity, inundation) that are typically absent from regional carbon assessments. Reveals a critical salinity-inundation threshold that will govern future emissions under sea-level rise.

**Method:**
Coupled ocean modeling with remote sensing data and empirical relationships derived from metadata synthesis to estimate spatiotemporal methane fluxes. Identified key environmental drivers (temperature, salinity, inundation) through decadal-scale variability analysis (2001–2020).

**Data:**
Ocean circulation model outputs, remote sensing datasets (marsh extent/inundation), empirical flux relationships from literature metadata, and IPCC climate scenarios for projections.

**Climate Relevance:**
Addresses a critical gap in coastal carbon budgets by quantifying how oceanic forcing (tidal dynamics, salinity gradients) modulates methane—a potent greenhouse gas with ~28× the warming potential of CO₂ over 100 years. Demonstrates that coastal wetlands' climate mitigation value is partially offset by methane release.

**Implications:**
Projections show methane emissions will increase with sea-level rise until ~0.75 m SLR, after which saltwater intrusion suppresses further growth. This nonlinear response is essential for accurate coastal carbon accounting in climate models and coastal adaptation planning.

**Limitations:**
Empirical relationships may not capture complex biogeochemical processes; projections depend on IPCC scenario assumptions; regional focus limits global applicability.

**TL;DR:**
Coastal tidal wetland methane emissions are controlled by a salinity-inundation seesaw that will amplify emissions under moderate sea-level rise but self-limit beyond 0.75 m.
